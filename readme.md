[TF2] Biohazard
=========

Zombie-style TF2 server plugin. Originally at https://github.com/x6herbius/smplugins, but I've split it out into its own repo for easier management.

This plugin is old, incomplete, and not actively maintained by me. Although I will sometimes make fixes or improvements if I think it's worth it, don't expect this to be kept up-to-date with TF2. However, do feel free to fork it and do what you want by yourself.
